Client Socket[IP + PORT] & Server Socket [PORT]
# Datagram sockets - connectionless sockets [UDP]
# Stream sockets - connection-oriented sockets[TCP]
# Raw sockets (or Raw IP sockets), typically available in routers and other network equipment. Here the transport layer is bypassed, and the packet headers are made accessible to the application.




1: Find available WiFi adapters
iw dev

2:Check device status
ip link show wlan0

3: Bring up the WiFi interface
ip link set wlan0 up

4: Check the connection status
iw wlan0 link

5: Scan to find WiFi Network
iw wlan0 scan

8: Get an IP using dhclient
dhclient wlan0
ip addr show wlan0
ip route show 

9: Get Connected Network
iwgetid


root@kali:~# iw dev
root@kali:~# ip link set wlan0 up
root@kali:~# iw wlan0 scan
root@kali:~# wpa_passphrase blackMOREOps >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
root@kali:~# wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
root@kali:~# iw wlan0 link
root@kali:~# dhclient wlan0
root@kali:~# ping 8.8.8.8
(Where wlan0 is wifi adapter and blackMOREOps is SSID)
(Add Routing manually)
root@kali:~# ip route add default via 10.0.0.138 dev wlan0
